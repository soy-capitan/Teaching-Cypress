    Tags - basic structure of html documents. Tells the browser how to view what kind of thing you are programing. img = image. tells the browser to render the image. location of a file. 
    The opening and closing brackets for html are < > . To begin a tag use <img>pretend.jpg</img>  - no spaces in tags! Must begin and end the statement
    HTML = Hypertext markup language
